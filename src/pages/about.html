		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		
		<p>
			I'm Kate & I'm a purple-haired, deaf goth learning to code. Based in Brisbane, I'm looking to join the tech industry as I've been told it's a disability-friendly industry. Having grown up using computers since before I could read (With the help of my older brothers reading out what's on the screen to me), I've dabbled a little over the years, building my own computers once my Dad taught me at age 10. Growing up on the internet in the late 90's, I saw the rise and growth of the information age, started to tinker with code via themes of the old school sites (Geocities comes to mind, plus Myspace of course).
