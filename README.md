## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to show what I have learnt over the last few weeks learning to code, presenting as a website that one would show to potential employers. This website includes mobile view and desktop view HTML and CSS styling that makes this site responsive, over a range of pages and various stylesheets for different pages or sections, to make a functional, working website.

## Target Audience

The target audience is potential employers looking to hire an aspiring junior web developer (myself ideally) or IT professionals looking to network or engage with other web developers, to view my learned skills and to see a little bit of who I am as a person, including my professional work history and experience. This website also serves as a way to potentially show family and friends my progress so far, in a professional manner.

## Functionality / Features

 **Navigation Bar**
- Mobile view dropdown style menu with hamburger icon

    - Located on the right top corner of every page in mobile view/smaller screens in the header; for easy access, allowing the user to navigate to all pages of the website.


- Desktop view horizontal text style menu

    - Located horizontally across the top in the header, starting from the right top corner going backwards, for easy access allowing the user to easily see and navigate to all the main pages of the website while viewing from a wider screen/desktop view. When hovered over Projects or Blogs, it shows a second hidden level of the menu, showing extra pages located related to that section.


**Home Icon**
- Home icon located on the left top corner of all pages in the header, viewable in both mobile and desktop views. Allows the user to easily go back to the home page.


**Mobile & Desktop views**
- Some page's main content, as well as all navigation bars, have two separate CSS stylesheets that makes the pages responsive; to change what the user sees depending on the size of the screen they are viewing from. This is labeled as 'mobile view' and 'desktop view' in the code and is utilised in the main content of the following pages; About page, Projects overview page, and Blogs overview page.  


**Link Buttons**
- Used on the Home page and Contact page, the buttons link to other pages, or to external sites outside of this website.


**Images with Tooltips**
- As well as having alt text, some images have a hoverable tooltip explaining to the user what the picture is of. (See [Project 02](https://k8g-portfolio.netlify.app/pages/project02) for example).

- Alt text tells the user what the image is supposed to be of, if the image link is broken for some reason, which is useful when trying to code websites, in that it tells you which image link is broken. It is also used by screen readers to read aloud to the visually impaired user what the image is, which is important for accessibility and making your website user-friendly for the visually impaired.


**Hover Behaviours**
- Allows the user to see when they are hovering over an interactable button or link. This is used in both navigational menus, as well as the buttons on About and Contact pages, and all links included on every page. There is also a hover reaction when hovering over the different projects and blogs in the Projects overview page and Blogs overview page. This makes it easier for the user to see what is interactable and what isn't.


**Back to Top Button**
- This button pops up when the user has scrolled down a certain amount, allowing the user to easily pop back to the top to access the navigation bar more quickly. It also has a colour change effect when hovered over.

### Mobile View Wireframes

- [Link to my wireframes page](https://k8g-portfolio.netlify.app/pages/wireframes)<br>
    (You can view the wireframes as PDF's hosted on my website if GitHub links below don't work)

High quality images/pdf links & lower quality screenshots included, in case the Github hosted PDF files don't load properly. (For some reason, the PDF files will not load fully when I try to view in GitHub, even though the full image is shown prior to being uploaded. So I am providing three ways to view the wireframes; PDF link below, low quality screenshots below, or PDF links on webpage above)<br>

## Sitemap

![Sitemap](/docs/Sitemap%20&%20Wireframes/T1A2_Portfolio%20Sitemap.drawio.png)

The site map shows all the available pages on the website. It starts with the Home page, which has a navgination bar that links to the rest of the site. There are also buttons which link to other pages or external site located on some of the pages (Home page, About page, Contacts page and some project pages.)

### Home Page
- This page is the first page you see; it has a navigation menu in the top left corner and has a dropdown menu feature when hovered over, allowing you to access other pages in the site. This navigation menu comes in two styles; mobile & desktop view. Mobile view has a hamburger menu icon as the point of access, while the desktop has an expanded text word menu, as there is more space for it. 

- This page includes a little introduction with a link that sends the user to the external website of the company I'm studying under, as well as a link button connecting the user to the next relevant page, which is the About Page.

### About Page
- This page has a bigger introduction telling the user about myself, the website creator, and includes professional information as well as interests & hobbies I have, to give the user a little taste of my personality and what I like. A picture of myself is located at the top center, to draw the user's attention to the intro. 

- This page has two different views depending on whether the user is viewing in mobile or desktop view.
    - Mobile view has a single column view, with posts under the other, scrolling downwards.
    - Desktop view has a single column at the top then splits into two columns to fill up the empty space that would otherwise be around the single column.

### Projects Page
- This page is an overview of the Project pages. It includes links to the relevant project pages, as well as a little snippet of the text from the post, and a relevant image. The rest of the post is available to be view when the link is clicked. 

### Blogs Page
- Similiar to the Projects page above, Blogs Page also is an overview of the available blog posts. Includes a mini preview of the images and text and a link to read more, if the user wishes.

### Contact Page
- This page has another picture of me, to remind the user who I am/what I look like, and professional links as well as my email contact. This allows the user to reach me if they would like to contact me.
