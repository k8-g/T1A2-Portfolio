## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to show what I have learnt over the last few weeks learning to code, presenting as a website that one would show to potential employers. This website includes mobile view and desktop view HTML and CSS styling that makes this site responsive, over a range of pages and various stylesheets for different pages or sections, to make a functional, working website.

## Target Audience

The target audience is potential employers looking to hire an aspiring junior web developer (myself ideally) or IT professionals looking to network or engage with other web developers, to view my learned skills and to see a little bit of who I am as a person, including my professional work history and experience. This website also serves as a way to potentially show family and friends my progress so far, in a professional manner.

## Functionality / Features

 **Navigation Bar**
- Mobile view dropdown style menu with hamburger icon

    Located on the right top corner of every page in mobile view/smaller screens in the header; for easy access, allowing the user to navigate to all pages of the website.


- Desktop view horizontal text style menu

    Located horizontally across the top in the header, starting from the right top corner going backwards, for easy access allowing the user to easily see and navigate to all the main pages of the website while viewing from a wider screen/desktop view. When hovered over Projects or Blogs, it shows a second hidden level of the menu, showing extra pages located related that section.


**Home Icon**
- Home icon located on the left top corner of all pages in the header, viewable in both mobile and desktop views. Allows the user to easily go back to the home page.


**Mobile & Desktop views**
- Some page's main content, as well as all navigation bars, have two separate CSS stylesheets that makes the pages responsive; to change what the user sees depending on the size of the screen they are viewing from. This is labeled as 'mobile view' and 'desktop view' in the code and is utilised in the main content of the following pages; About page, Projects overview page, and Blogs overview page.  


**Buttons**
- Used on the Home page and Contact page, the buttons link to other pages, or to external sites outside of this website.


**Images with tooltips**
- As well as having alt text, some images have a hoverable tooltip explaining to the user what the picture is of. (See [Project 02](https://k8g-portfolio.netlify.app/pages/project02) for example).

Alt text tells the user what the image is supposed to be of, if the image link is broken for some reason, which is useful when trying to code websites, in that it tells you which image link is broken. It is also used by screen readers to read aloud to the visually impaired user, what the image is, which is important for accessibility and making your website user-friendly for the visually impaired.


**Hover Behaviours**
- Allows the user to see when they are hovering over an interactable button or link. This is used in both navigational menus, as well as the buttons on About and Contact pages, and all links included on every page. There is also a hover reaction when hovering over the different projects and blogs in the Projects overview page and Blogs overview page. This makes it easier for the user to see what is interactable and what isn't.
